# Getting to Philosophy

Clicking on the first link in the main body of a Wikipedia article and repeating the process for subsequent articles would usually lead to the article Philosophy.

The program receives a Wikipedia link as an input, goes to another normal link and repeates this process until either Philosophy page is reached, or we are in an article without any outgoing Wikilinks, or stuck in a loop.

A "normal link" is a link from the main page article, not in a box, is blue (red is for non-existing articles), not in parentheses, not italic and not a footnote.
